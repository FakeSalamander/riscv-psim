-Three levels of cache

    Decide level of associativity


    CACHE DESIGN:

        settings holder for overall size

        settings holder for set size

        settings holder for row length


        -input holder for physical address

        -intermediary holders for  tag, set index, offset

        - attribute of Set List

            each set is itself a list of Row structs

            - each Row has a Tag, a Valid Bool, and an array of Bytes/Words (unsigned ints?)
