- make Background into a chapter


- "This field"
    - Add a sentence abt computer architecture first
    DONE
    
- Same thing  with ISA

    - Move Abstract CPU BEFORE ISA
    
    DONE
    
- IN ISA discussion...
    - talk not just about instruction
    
    - also about what hardware it reveals
        - r0 is zeor in mips, so on
        
        - do this in RISC-V

    TO-DO: Review RISC-V's hardware specifications!
        
- In steps, remove 6th step

        - split step 2 into two, describe  how it is arbitrary
        DONE

- Iin pipelining, describe non-5-stages
    DONE!!!
        
        
- Move CPU features to main body 
    DONE!!

MAIN BODY:L

    - Two thing to talk about
        - Your features/implementation
        
        
        - Your design/goals
